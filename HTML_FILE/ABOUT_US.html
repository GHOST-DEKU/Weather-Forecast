<h2 style="FONT-SIZE:20px;color:yellow;"><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
<p style="FONT-SIZE:15px;"><b>Weather App is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place. It is very important to get educated on the current weather situation of a particular location as preferred since it affects the day to day life of everyone. It is more effective if we can get quickly updated on current weather status of a required location, as it makes it easy to handle not only our activities, but also our livelihoods too. A huge problem that we are facing nowadays is inability to know real weather status in such places. So if we need to know the current situation in a certain place, it is better to ask from a person who is in that area recently or currently. He is a better source than any prevailing weather information.</b></p>

<p style="FONT-SIZE:15px;"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:18px;">SKY-CAST WEATHER APP</span> is a <span style="FONT-SIZE:18px;">JAVA POWERED WEATHER PREDICTION SYSTEM</span> which aims at providing real-time and Predictive informations on Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Precipitation and Wind Speed through charts, graphs and maps.</b></p>
<h2 style="FONT-SIZE:20px;color:yellow;"><u>ABSTRACT</u></h2>
<p style="FONT-SIZE:15px;"><b>The project focuses on utilizing Java to build a weather application that retrieves weather data from an external API, processes it, and presents it to the user in a user-friendly interface. We explore the integration of API calls, JSON parsing, and graphical user interface (GUI) development using JavaFX. The application allows users to enter a location and view current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The project showcases the practical application of Java programming skills in real-world scenarios.</b></p>
<h2 style="FONT-SIZE:20px;color:yellow;"><u>CONCLUSION</u></h2>
<p style="FONT-SIZE:15px;"><b>In conclusion, the development of a weather application in Java provides valuable insights into various aspects of software development, including API integration, data processing, and user interface design. Through this project, we have demonstrated the practical application of Java programming skills in building a functional and user-friendly application. The project highlights the importance of proper planning, modularization, and error handling in software development. By harnessing the power of Java and leveraging external APIs, we have created a versatile weather application that fulfills the needs of users to access accurate and timely weather information. This project serves as a testament to the capabilities of Java in developing real-world applications and provides a solid foundation for further exploration and refinement of Java programmingÂ skills.</b></p>
