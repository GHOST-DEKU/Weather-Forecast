<h2 style="FONT-SIZE:20px;color:yellow;"><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
<p style="FONT-SIZE:15px;"><b>Weather App is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place. It is very important to get educated on the current weather situation of a particular location as preferred since it affects the day to day life of everyone. It is more effective if we can get quickly updated on current weather status of a required location, as it makes it easy to handle not only our activities, but also our livelihoods too. A huge problem that we are facing nowadays is inability to know real weather status in such places. So if we need to know the current situation in a certain place, it is better to ask from a person who is in that area recently or currently. He is a better source than any prevailing weather information.</b></p>
